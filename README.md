# GiBiLogic "Elements" library

Often we find ourselves writing the same code for different projects, over and over again.

We got bored, so we decided to collect all these bits and pieces of code in ready-to-use packages.

# Geocoding Element

This package contains useful classes for working with geographical coordinates.

It uses Google's geocoding service; you can find more informations on the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start).

## Installation

Add this package to the `composer.json` of your application with the console command:

```bash
composer require gibilogic/element-geocoding
```

Or, if you are using the `composer.phar` version, use the console command:
